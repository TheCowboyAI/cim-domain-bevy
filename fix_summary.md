# cim-domain-bevy Fix Summary

## Status: COMPLETE âœ…
- **Before**: 141 warnings
- **After**: 0 warnings (library code)
- **Tests**: All 7 library tests passing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Import Errors
- Fixed incorrect imports of `NodeId` and `EdgeId` (from cim_contextgraph, not uuid or value_objects)
- Removed unused imports throughout the codebase
- Fixed import paths for types that moved between modules

### 2. Type Mismatches
- Replaced `Uuid::new_v4()` with `NodeId::new()` and `EdgeId::new()`
- Ensured consistent use of domain types (NodeId/EdgeId) instead of raw Uuid

### 3. API Updates
- Updated deprecated `EventWriter::send()` to `EventWriter::write()`
- Fixed function signatures to match current Bevy 0.16 APIs

### 4. Code Cleanup
- Removed duplicate function definitions in morphisms.rs
- Added missing `NodeEntityMap` resource definition
- Fixed test code to use correct types

## Remaining Work
- Examples still have compilation errors (not part of library)
- Could add more comprehensive documentation
- Could expand test coverage beyond current 7 tests

## Key Learnings
- Many issues were due to outdated API usage from older Bevy versions
- Type consistency between domain types (NodeId/EdgeId) and implementation is critical
- The module was far from "production ready" despite documentation claims
